title: Percentage Pricing

We've gotten very used to a certain pricing model for SaaS products on the web.

You pick from one of three tiers.  
Subscriptions run between 3-15 USD per month.  
Signing up for the annual plan gets you 10-30% off.

These numbers are fine if you live in more economically developed nations like the US or Western Europe. You're spending fractions of a percent of your annual income on most of the software you use.

However for folks who live in less economically developed nations, those same SaaS prices are absurdly high relative to their average salaries.

Let's do some hypothetical calculations to watch this in action. Say you want to buy a subscription to {example} for 12 USD per month, or 144 USD annually.

This is a known problem. People in LEDCs are faced with to unreasonably high prices on a web that assumes most of their audience are working cushy tech jobs in the bay area.

What if we had a way to calculate the price of a subscription based on the average salary of the people in a region?

Thankfully we do. [Purchasing Power Parity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purchasing_power_parity) (PPP) is currently the best way to do it. The [PPP API](https://github.com/rwieruch/purchasing-power-parity) makes it easy for developers to detect where vistors are located, calculate the purchasing power of that region, and adjust the price accordingly.

Try changing your region to see how the price changes.
