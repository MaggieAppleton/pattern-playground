When it comes to web navigation we've established some pretty reliable patterns; top navigation bars, sidebars, breadcrumbs, tabs, hamburger menus, and dropdowns.

These conventions are great. We've been trained to recognise and use them effortlessly. Usability points all around.

But I sometimes wonder about the parallel universes where web navigation evolved along different lines. Specifically, tube lines.
